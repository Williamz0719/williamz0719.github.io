        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is William Zheng and I am currently a rising senior. I am a Asian-American who is activly trying to work towards their goals. Some things that I value would be hard work, honesty, persistence and that anything can happen if you put your mind to it.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="education">
        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>As mentioned previously, I am currently a rising senior of Baruch College Campus High School which is situated right next to Madison Square Garden and the famed Flatiron Building. 
        With my school being situated in such a area, one would assume it's quite large, however, it's small but that's not something of huge concern. 
        I was first admitted in September of 2021 and expect to graduate in June of 2025 and I must say, the first 3 years flew by in a instant. At first I was pretty anxious of what was to come, however, that feeling soon dissipated only after a month of freshman year. 
        It's crazy thinking back on it now just how much fun high school was during those first 3 years which is why I am very glad to have meet the people I met and learnt the things that was taught to me in this community. </p>

    <div id="future">
        <h1>Future Intrest</h1>
        <p>As of right now, I am unsure what career I want to pursure in the near future but what I do know is that I want it to be related with computer science due to the fascinating nature of it all.
           Anyhow, I think that as of right now, I plan on just trying to find more intrest and hobbies that I believe could align with a future career for me. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="post">
        <h1>Post High School Plans</h1>
        <p>Hopefully during this last stretch of my high school year, I would have an idea of careers that intrest me and based off it will evidently allow me to decide where I want to study. 
            As of now, the one college I want to attend would be UT Austin, which I know will be a huge commitment, but I believe that it will be all worth it in the longrun.
